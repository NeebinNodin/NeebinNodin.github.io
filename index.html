                <p>Hello, my name is Neebinnodin Buswa and 34 years old. I'm half Ojibwe and Finnish and my name means
                    'Summer Wind'. I go by Neebin for the most part. I have been called by many variations of my name
                    over the years, but I don't mind what names people come up with. As long as it's not offensive, I'm
                    fine with it.</p>
                <p>I currently live in Appleton. I lived most of my life in Michigan. I was born in Sault Ste Marie, Michigan, grow up in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, and spend most of my teens in Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I spent 14 years of my life in prison but I just recently got off of a two-year parole. Now I'm trying to further my education. </p>
                <p>I'm currently in the IT Software Developer program. I'm in my second year of taking classes. When I
                    first started at FVTC I was in the Industrail Engineering Technologies, but I switched my program
                    August 2023.</p>
                <p>I enjoy read books more than watching TV or movies. My favorite genre to read is fantasy. The
                    following is a list of some my favorite books:</p>
